											<p><strong>Introduction </strong>In this modern era, the significance of online platforms cannot be exaggerated. The Internet 
												has become an integral part of our daily lives; no one can deny it. One particular area where 
												this digital transformation is evident is in healthcare. With the proliferation of healthcare 
												websites, individuals can now access medical information, book appointments, and even 
												consult with healthcare professionals online. For our comparative evaluation, we have chosen 
												healthcare websites due to their importance in providing vital information and services to the 
												public. By leveraging web performance audit tools such as Google Lighthouse, we aim to 
												assess the performance, accessibility, and search engine optimization (SEO) of these websites. 
												By analyzing key metrics, we can gain insights into how effectively these platforms serve their 
												users and identify areas for improvement. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we will 
												compare multiple healthcare websites within the same domain and examine them from different 
												aspects. Through this comparative analysis, we aim to provide valuable insights into the 
												strengths and weaknesses of these websites, ultimately contributing to their enhancement and 
												optimization for the benefit of users.</p>
											<p>A <strong>website</strong> known as a collection of web pages that include the content of that website's goal 
												for user's needs and located on the World Wide Web (WWW) on the Internet that allows all 
												resources to be accessed through the Internet by following policy on Hypertext Transfer 
												Protocol (HTTP). Measuring consumers' perception of website quality is crucial when 
												designing a website, and it depends on rigorous and comprehensive methods [1]. Websites 
												are vital for accessing and gathering information because they act worldwide for news and 
												knowledge, allowing users to spread information quickly and widely.</p>
											<p>The <strong>hospital website</strong> serves as a virtual front door for patients and potential visitors, 
												providing them with essential information about the hospital's services, specialities, and 
												facilities [2]. A hospital website is created and maintained by a hospital or healthcare 
												institution. Its primary purpose is to provide information and resources related to the 
												hospital's services.
												</p>
											<p>Several studies have evaluated the effectiveness and utility of <strong>Google Lighthouse</strong>, an open source tool for auditing web pages [3]. It is concluded that Lighthouse offers 
												comprehensive performance audits with detailed optimization recommendations, making 
												it valuable for web developers. Meanwhile, web developers also analyzed web performance 
												trends using Lighthouse data, emphasizing its role in driving optimizations and the need 
												for continuous refinement in interpreting results for optimal web development outcomes.

											</a>
											<p>In conclusion, based on results and discussion using Google Lighthouse on the Top 6 Hospital 
                                                Websites, four metrics performance, accessibility, best practice and SEO were used to evaluate 
                                                the website. As a result, Stanford Medicine is the best performance indicator with the most 
                                                significant impact on users. Stanford Medicine's website achieves exemplary performance with 
                                                a Google Lighthouse score 66, showcasing fast loading times and efficient resource loading. 
                                                Its high accessibility score of 91 and perfect scores in best practices and SEO indicate 
                                                meticulous attention to detail, keyboard navigation, and mobile friendliness. At the same time, 
                                                best performance and accessibility indicate strong security and user-friendliness. Compared to 
                                                other hospitals' websites, Stanford Medicine's holistic approach to website development 
                                                ensures an outstanding user experience, positioning it as a leader in performance, accessibility, 
                                                and search engine optimization.</p>
